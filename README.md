Filter common <b>res</b>earch paper terms to **real** meanings. Takes a pdf and outputs an rtf.

The terms are defined in *A Glossary for Research Reports*.
Allegedly, this was originally published in *A Random Walk in Science*.

### Why?
Why not? Actually, there are a few reasons,
- It was born out of a conversation I had with my academic advisor on the common practice of deliberate obfuscation in research papers.
- I always wanted to try and parse pdf's.
- It helped to clean out the python cobwebs in my brain.

### Dependencies
This script requires the [pdfminer](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/) module. Attempting to run without pdfminer will cause the script to prompt the user to download it then rerun.
